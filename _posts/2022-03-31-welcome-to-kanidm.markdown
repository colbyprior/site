Today I created a website with Jekyll for github pages, This was my first time working with jeykll, I had some problem with ruby 3 and Jekyll but I gave up on local testing and publish it directly to github.
I talked to James, He prefered Pelican and Hugo over Jekyll.
I created this for a starting point because of the nice integration between Github and Jekyll. later maybe we will change it.
