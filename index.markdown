Kanidm is an identity management platform written in rust. Our goals are:

* Modern identity management platform
* Simple to deploy and integrate with
* Extensible for various needs
* Correct and secure behaviour by default

Today the project is still under heavy development to achieve these goals - We have many foundational
parts in place, and many of the required security features, but it is still an Alpha, and should be
treated as such.
